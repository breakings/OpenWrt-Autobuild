#### R2S Feature

1.Fixed DDR4 333MHz problem

2.Replaced [Shadowsocks-libev](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev) with [Shadowsocks-rust](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust) for the excellent performance. If your Shadowsocks are running with a non-AEAD encrypt method, please convert into Xray-core to run Shadowsocks or a terrible speed of fewer than 1 Mbps. And it's strongly recommended that you abandon outdated encrypt methods.
